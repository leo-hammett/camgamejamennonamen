UNITY SETUP CHECKLIST (5 minutes)
===================================

✅ DONE: All scripts enabled (removed #if false)
✅ DONE: Configs created (GameConfig, MapConfig, GeneratorConfig, PlayerConfig)

YOUR TURN IN UNITY:

[ ] 1. Open Unity and wait for it to compile
      - Should compile with no errors now!

[ ] 2. Create Generator Prefab (30 seconds)
      - GameObject > Create Empty
      - Name it "GeneratorPrefab"
      - Add Component > StoneGenerator
      - Add Component > Sprite Renderer (set color to red)
      - Drag to Project window to make prefab
      - Delete from scene

[ ] 3. Link Configs (1 minute)
      - Select GameConfig in Project
      - Drag GeneratorConfig into its slot
      - Drag PlayerConfig into its slot
      - Select GeneratorConfig
      - Drag GeneratorPrefab into "Generator Prefab" slot

[ ] 4. Setup Scene (30 seconds)
      - GameObject > Create Empty > "GameManager"
      - Add Component > GameManager
      - Drag GameConfig into its slot
      
      - GameObject > Create Empty > "GeneratorManager"
      - Add Component > GeneratorManager
      - Drag GeneratorConfig into its slot
      
      - Find "Circle" object
      - Add Component > PlayerController
      - Add Component > TrailSystem
      - Tag as "Player"
      
      - On Tilemap object
      - Add Component > MapSystem

[ ] 5. Press Play!
      - Generators should spawn
      - Player should move with mouse (existing Movement.cs)
      - Trail should render (existing Movement.cs)

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- NullReferenceException? Check configs are linked
- No generators? Check GeneratorPrefab is assigned
- Can't see anything? Check camera Z = -10

That's it! The game should be running!
