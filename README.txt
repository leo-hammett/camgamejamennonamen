You play as a mole in a rectangular bordered map. The player follows the mouse and is constantly moving. As the player moves, it draws a line, and when the player intersects with the line it drew it starts a new line.
There are "stone growers" that will move towards the player and will generate stone around it, like a pen. If the stone grower is inside a closed loop when the player intersects with its line then the stone grower dies. Any stone generated by the stone grower will remain after the stone grower dies. The strength of stone and the radius of the stone drawn by the stone grower, as well as the speed of the stone grower, is variable.
If the player enters stone, the strength of the stone will impact how fast the stone growers move. If the stone grower reacher the player, the player dies.
